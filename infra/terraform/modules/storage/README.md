# `storage` module

One private S3 bucket, `<name_prefix>-objects` (`OBJECTS_BUCKET`):

- `packages/<sha256>.zip`: problem test packages in the Kattis layout, addressed by content hash and kept as long as the problem exists. Hidden tests leave the bucket only through the API's internal endpoint to a judge worker (the judges have no S3 permission).
- `exports/`: problem exports and report downloads, expiring after `export_expiration_days`.
- `backups/`: database dumps, expiring after `backup_retention_days`.

Versioning is on, and replaced or deleted versions stay recoverable for `noncurrent_retention_days`. Public access blocked, bucket-owner-enforced ownership, TLS-only bucket policy, SSE-KMS with the CMK (bucket key on). Applied in `local-floci` as `codejudge-local-objects` with `enforce_tls = false` (the emulator speaks plain HTTP) and `force_destroy = true`.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name_prefix` | Prefix for every resource name. The bucket is <name_prefix>-objects. | `string` | required |
| `kms_key_arn` | CMK for SSE-KMS. Null falls back to SSE-S3. | `string` | `null` |
| `enforce_tls` | Deny any request not made over TLS. Disable only for an emulator that speaks plain HTTP. | `bool` | `true` |
| `noncurrent_retention_days` | Days a replaced or deleted object version stays recoverable. | `number` | `30` |
| `export_expiration_days` | Days a problem export or report download (exports/) is kept. | `number` | `7` |
| `backup_retention_days` | Days a database backup (backups/) is kept. | `number` | `35` |
| `cors_origins` | Browser origins allowed to GET objects with JavaScript (the dashboard URL). Empty = no CORS configuration. | `list(string)` | `[]` |
| `force_destroy` | Allow `terraform destroy` to delete a non-empty bucket. Never in production. | `bool` | `false` |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `bucket_name` | Objects bucket name (OBJECTS_BUCKET). |
| `bucket_arn` | Objects bucket ARN, for IAM policies. |
