# One private bucket for everything too large to keep in Postgres:
#
#   packages/<sha256>.zip  problem test packages (Kattis layout), addressed by content hash.
#                          A submission is judged against the package of its problem version,
#                          so these are kept for as long as the problem exists.
#   exports/               problem exports and gradebook downloads; short lived.
#   backups/               `make backup` database dumps; kept backup_retention_days.
#
# Versioning is on: an overwritten or deleted object stays recoverable for
# noncurrent_retention_days, which protects hidden test data from a bad upload or an
# accidental delete. Hidden tests never leave this bucket except to a judge worker, which
# fetches them through the API's internal endpoint (the judge has no S3 permission).
