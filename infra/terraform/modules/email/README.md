# `email` module

Amazon SES for invitation mail: a domain identity with Easy DKIM (records in Route53 when a zone is given, otherwise in the `dkim_records` output), a configuration set with TLS required, reputation metrics, bounce and complaint suppression, and a CloudWatch event destination. `send_policy_json` lets the api send only as `from_address` and only through this identity. New accounts start in the SES sandbox: request production access before inviting candidates.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default |

| `domain` | Domain mail is sent from (an SES domain identity), e.g. judge.example.com. | `string` | required |
| `from_address` | The only From address the api may send as, e.g. no-reply@judge.example.com. | `string` | required |
| `route53_zone_id` | Hosted zone that receives the DKIM records. Null: create them yourself (dkim_records output). | `string` | `null` |
