# `service` module

The application plane on ECS Fargate behind one Application Load Balancer:

| App | Role | Exposure |
|---|---|---|
| `api` | the API (`/api/*`), probes, docs; the judges' internal endpoints | ALB on `hostname`; `/internal/*` refused at the edge, reached only through Cloud Map |
| `worker` | contest timers, rollups, plagiarism runs, cleanup | none (optional Prometheus scrape) |
| `web` | the Next.js app (every other path) | ALB |
| `migrate` | one-off task for `migrate`, `create-admin`, `seed-demo` | none |

The judge workers are not here: they need a custom seccomp profile, which Fargate cannot take, so they run on EC2 capacity in the `judge` module and reach the api through its Cloud Map name.

Every app: its own security group (ingress only from the ALB or named callers), its own execution and task roles (only the api, worker and migrate touch S3 and KMS; only the api may send mail through SES, with `send_mail`), read-only root filesystem, ARM64, no public IP, deployment circuit breaker with rollback. WAF with AWS managed rules; the body rules that mistake source code and Markdown for attacks only count.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name_prefix` | Deployment prefix, e.g. "codejudge-prod". At most 24 characters, so target group names stay unique within AWS's 32-character limit. | `string` | required |

| `certificate_arn` | ACM certificate (same region) for the HTTPS listener, covering hostname. | `string` | required |
| `route53_zone_id` | Hosted zone to create the hostname alias record in. Null: point DNS at alb_dns_name yourself. | `string` | `null` |
| `api_image` | Full api image reference (also runs the worker and migrate), e.g. <registry>/codejudge-prod/api:<tag>. | `string` | required |
| `web_image` | Full web image reference, e.g. <registry>/codejudge-prod/web:<tag>. | `string` | required |
| `container_port` | Port every container listens on (PORT). | `number` | `8080` |
| `environment` | Plain environment for api, worker and migrate (RUNTIME_PUBLIC_URL, RUNTIME_INTERNAL_URL and OBJECTS_BUCKET are set by the module). Never secrets. | `map(string)` | `{}` |
| `web_environment` | Plain environment for web (API_INTERNAL_URL and RUNTIME_PUBLIC_URL are set by the module). Never secrets. | `map(string)` | `{}` |
| `secrets` | Secrets injected into api, worker and migrate: [{ name, valueFrom = "<secret arn>:<json key>::" }] (secrets module ecs_secrets). | `list(object)` | `[]` |
| `kms_key_arn` | CMK that seals provider API keys, encrypts the objects bucket and the injected secrets. | `string` | required |
| `objects_bucket_arn` | Objects bucket (storage module bucket_arn). | `string` | required |
| `objects_bucket_name` | Objects bucket name (storage module bucket_name), passed as OBJECTS_BUCKET. | `string` | required |
| `db_security_group_id` | Database security group; api, worker and migrate get ingress on it. | `string` | required |
| `db_port` | Database port. | `number` | `5432` |
| `cache_security_group_id` | Cache security group; api, worker and migrate get ingress on it. | `string` | required |
| `cache_port` | Cache port. | `number` | `6379` |
| `log_group_names` | CloudWatch log group per app: { api, worker, web, migrate } (observability module log_group_names). | `map(string)` | required |
| `logs_kms_key_arn` | CMK for the WAF log group. Null uses CloudWatch's default encryption. | `string` | `null` |
| `cpu_architecture` | ARM64 (Graviton, cheaper) or X86_64. Images must be built for it. | `string` | `"ARM64"` |
| `container_insights` | ECS Container Insights: enabled, enhanced or disabled. | `string` | `"enabled"` |
| `api_cpu` | Fargate CPU units per api task. | `number` | `1024` |
| `api_memory` | Fargate memory (MiB) per api task. | `number` | `2048` |
| `api_min_count` | Minimum (and initial) api task count. | `number` | `2` |
| `api_max_count` | Maximum api task count under autoscaling. Equal to api_min_count disables scaling. | `number` | `6` |
| `worker_cpu` | Fargate CPU units for the worker. | `number` | `512` |
| `worker_memory` | Fargate memory (MiB) for the worker. | `number` | `1024` |
| `worker_count` | Worker task count. Not autoscaled; deploys replace tasks rather than double them. | `number` | `1` |
| `web_cpu` | Fargate CPU units per web task. | `number` | `512` |
| `web_memory` | Fargate memory (MiB) per web task. | `number` | `1024` |

| `cpu_target_percent` | Average CPU the autoscaler aims for (api and web). | `number` | `60` |
| `idle_timeout` | Load balancer idle timeout in seconds. Verdict streams send a keep-alive every 15 s, so this only reaps abandoned connections. | `number` | `120` |
| `deletion_protection` | Block accidental deletion of the load balancer. | `bool` | `true` |
| `access_logs_bucket` | Existing bucket for load balancer access logs (needs the ELB log-delivery bucket policy). Null disables. | `string` | `null` |
| `metrics_allowed_cidrs` | Source CIDRs allowed to read /metrics through the load balancer. Empty: /metrics answers 404 at the edge. | `list(string)` | `[]` |

| `waf_rate_limit_per_5min` | Requests per source IP per 5 minutes before WAF blocks. Keep it high: SDK backends often sit behind one NAT address. | `number` | `20000` |
| `waf_log_retention_days` | WAF log retention. | `number` | `30` |
| `worker_metrics_cidrs` | Source CIDRs (an in-VPC Prometheus) allowed to scrape the worker's /metrics. Empty: the worker has no ingress at all. | `list(string)` | `[]` |
| `worker_metrics_port` | Port the worker serves /metrics on; must match WORKER_METRICS_PORT (default 9464). | `number` | `9464` |
| `ai_egress` | Extra egress from the api tasks for a self-hosted AI hint model not on HTTPS 443, as { cidr, port } pairs (for example Ollama or vLLM inside the VPC). Empty: HTTPS only. | `list(object)` | `[]` |
| `send_mail` | Attach mail_policy_json to the api task role (invitations through SES). | `bool` | `false` |
| `mail_policy_json` | IAM policy for sending invitation mail (email module send_policy_json), with send_mail. | `string` | `null` |
