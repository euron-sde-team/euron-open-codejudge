# `network` module

VPC across `az_count` availability zones with public and private subnets, NAT (one per AZ, or a single one with `single_nat_gateway`), an S3 gateway endpoint (test packages, exports and backups never cross NAT), optional interface endpoints (ECR, ECS, CloudWatch Logs, Secrets Manager, KMS, SSM) so private tasks and judge hosts reach AWS APIs without the internet, and encrypted VPC flow logs. The default security group is locked down (no rules).

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name_prefix` | Prefix for every resource name, e.g. "codejudge-prod". | `string` | required |
| `cidr_block` | VPC CIDR. Split into /20 public subnets (low half) and /20 private subnets (high half). | `string` | `"10.41.0.0/16"` |
| `az_count` | Number of availability zones to span (2 or 3). | `number` | `3` |
| `single_nat_gateway` | One shared NAT gateway (cheaper, dev) instead of one per AZ (resilient, prod). | `bool` | `true` |
| `logs_kms_key_arn` | CMK that encrypts the flow-log group (its key policy must allow CloudWatch Logs). Null uses CloudWatch's default encryption. | `string` | `null` |
| `flow_log_retention_days` | Retention for VPC flow logs (REJECT + ACCEPT) in CloudWatch Logs. 0 disables flow logs. | `number` | `30` |
| `enable_interface_endpoints` | Create KMS and Secrets Manager interface endpoints so those calls never leave the VPC. | `bool` | `true` |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `vpc_id` | VPC id. |
| `vpc_cidr_block` | VPC CIDR. |
| `public_subnet_ids` | Public subnets (ALB, NAT). |
| `private_subnet_ids` | Private subnets (ECS tasks, RDS, ElastiCache), one per AZ. |
