"""Periodic background tasks, registered by the domains that own them.

The background worker runs every registered task on each tick. Tasks must be idempotent
and safe across replicas (claim rows with ``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` or use plain
conditional UPDATEs), because several workers may run them at once.
