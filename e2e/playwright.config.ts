 * Browser end-to-end tests against the running local stack (`make up && make demo`): the
 * web app, the API, two real judge workers running submissions in the sandbox, Postgres,
 * Redis, Mailpit for invitation emails and, on Floci, S3 and KMS.
 *
 *   pnpm test                 every suite
 *   E2E_HEADED=1 pnpm test    watch it
 *
 * Every suite creates its own data with a per-run suffix, so reruns pass on the seeded
 * stack. The suites share one database, so they run in a single worker, in file order.
